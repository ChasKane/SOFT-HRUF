# SOFT-HRUF
This is the github page for the electronics company SoftHRUF run by Ecca Scott Urueta.
A strong contributer, ChasKane (YoungSage) helped design the first itteration of the
PCB for the company's custom stenography keyboard.

The most recent version of the keyboard integrates a microcontroller (Atmega32U4-AU)
onto the PCB, and is split at the middle, connected by a 10p10c (ethernet but with 10
wires) connector (so many wires because Chas couldn't figure out how to use a
multiplexing chip in time).

Please direct any questions about the electronics to ChasKane (LawrenceCKane@gmail.com).
For all other questions, comments, etc. please email Scott (email to come).

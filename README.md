# SOFT-HRUF
This is the github page for the electronics company SoftHRUF run by Ecca Scott Urueta.
A strong contributer, ChasKane (YoungSage) designed the PCB for the company's custom
stenography keyboard.

This most recent version of the keyboard integrates a microcontroller (Atmega32U4-AU)
onto the PCB, and is split at the middle, connected by a 10p10c wire (ethernet but with 10
wires).

# Current work
Current design is in the `/Split Corded/` folder.

# Future work
We're currently contracting on a more streamlined version with bluetooth, micro SD slot, and USB-C. Contact us for more updates!

# Contact
Please direct any questions about the electronics on the Split Corded keyboard to ChasKane `LawrenceCKane@gmail.com`.
For all other questions, comments, etc. please email Scott `ecca@softhruf.love`.
